One approach is an entire class, or portion of a class, that covers ethical reasoning, examples are outlined in @lesser2004ethical and @Tractenberg2015.

I'm more interested in smaller scale lessons and activities that can be integrated into existing Data Science and Statistical Methods classes. I think there are two obstacles that prevent me from integrating ethics lessons in my own classes:

* A lack of example lessons or activities that I can remix or adapt for my own classes.  For a lesson to be useful to me, it needs clearly articulated pre-requisite knowledge for students,  learning objectives and ideas for adapting the lesson to different contexts or levels of mastery.  See  [Ten Quick Tips for Reviewing Lessons](http://third-bit.com/2019/04/24/reviewing-lessons.html) for other ideas for lesson requirements.

* Pointers to resources to help me, as a teacher, master the required background so I feel comfortable teaching topics are  outside my own training in Statistics and Data Science.

This document is a record of some of my reading around these ideas, and is a work in progress.

## A learning trajectory for ethical decision making

A series of papers by Rochelle Tractenberg and co-authors lay out a set of Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) required for ethical decision making, with particular emphasis on responsible research and statistical practice. 

The KSAs are attractive because they are, in the authors words, **learnable** and **improvable**.  They therefore provide a good starting point for defining specific learning objectives for lessons and mastery goals for students.

* @tractenberg2012mastery defines the six KSAs along with indicators that identify varying degrees of mastery of each KSA.  This paper uses Responsible Conduct of Research as defined by the NIH Office of Research Integrity to provide particular content areas for application and demonstration of the KSAs, which may be less relevant to undergraduate students in Data Science.  
    
    **Table 1** crosses the six KSAs with the levels of mastery (Novice, Beginner, Competent and Proficient).  It's particularly useful to look at the novice level (perhaps as appropriate for students in an Intro to Data Science course) and the master level (as a guide for what I should know as a teacher, although I feel nowhere near this level).
    
    **Table 2** crosses the six KSAs with opportunities in conventional academic training for demonstrating the levels of mastery, as an argument that most current opportunities fail to give address many of the KSAs and tend to focus on the early parts of the learning trajectory.  Georgetown Univeristy is the specific example, but I suspect this pattern is common to many universities.
    
    **Table 3** crosses specific topics in RCR (e.g. Safe lab practices, Collaborative research, Peer review) with ways a practicioner may demonstrte them over their career from undergraduate to senior faculty. 

* @tractenberg2013ethical takes the same KSAs but uses the American Statistical Association's Ethical Guidelines as content areas.  
    
    **Table A1** crosses the KSAs with the ASA Ethical guideline areas at the Novice level, providing questions that might prompt answers that demonstrate attainment of this level. 
    
    The ASA's guidelines have been updated since this paper, so check they translate to the current guidelines.
    
The KSA's certainly help provide a framework for thinking about what students need to master and how their mastery develops, (and, for instance, helped me understand gaps in my mastery), but details of specific lessons aren't given, nor where to go to fill in your own gaps in the KSAs.
